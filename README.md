# Deep-fake-detection
🎭 Deep Fake Detection

An AI-powered Deep Fake Detection system that identifies manipulated or AI-generated media using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques. The project aims to distinguish between authentic and forged content, helping combat misinformation, identity fraud, and malicious media manipulation.

📌 Overview

Deepfakes are synthetic media generated using advanced AI models such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). While these technologies have beneficial applications, they can also be misused to create deceptive content.

This project uses Deep Learning models to analyze facial features and image patterns to determine whether a media file is Real or Fake.
